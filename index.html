                Tiny Desk Concerts is a video series of live concerts hosted by NPR Music at the desk of All Songs
                Considered host Bob Boilen in Washington, D.C.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Tiny Desk Concert came about in 2008 after Boilen and NPR Music editor Stephen Thompson left
                South by Southwest frustrated that they couldn't hear the music over the crowd noise.Thompson
                joked that the musician, folk singer Laura Gibson, should just perform at Boilen's desk.A month later
                Boilen arranged for her to do just that, making an impromptu recording and posting it online.The
                name is taken from Boilen's 1970s psychedelic dance band called Tiny Desk Unit.

                During the COVID-19 pandemic, NPR Music has enlisted artists to instead record their own virtual
                performances under the re-branded title Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts.The last Tiny Desk concert to be
                taped from NPR Studios was Sudan Archives, on March 11, 2020, but it was not released until June 22,
                2020, by which time some other artists had already filmed Tiny Desk concerts from home.

                As of August 2018, the series included more than 800 concerts viewed a collective 2 billion times on
                YouTube.
                The series has previously drawn criticism for narrowness in the musical genres it includes—described as
                focused on "hipster-infused indie rock" by Zachary Crockett at Vox[3]—to the exclusion of genres like
                country and hip-hop.However, the series' musical focus has broadened in scope over time.
                Performer Anderson .Paak's appearance on the series is Tiny Desk Concerts' most popular video with over
                67 million views (as of April 2021), surpassing (from February 2021) the previous number 1 viewed video
                of T-Pain, seen 20.2 million times.Popular entries include Mac Miller's set (featuring Thundercat),
                viewed more than 44.4 million times as of September 2020. </p>
